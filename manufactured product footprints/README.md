3. Under the **Product Groups** section, select the **Add** button and choose the following products:

4. Set the **Calculation Period** to Jan 1,2022 to Mar 31,2022.
5. Set the **Calculation Interval** to 1.
6. Select the **Validate** button from the action buttons on the top row. 
    - Verify that the validation is successful. If it is, you will see a success message in the footer.
